# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer is likely to **churn (leave a service)** using machine learning models. It helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention measures.

The complete analysis, modeling, and evaluation are implemented in **Google Colab**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Analyze customer behavior patterns  
- Prepare data for machine learning  
- Handle class imbalance in churn data  
- Train and compare multiple ML models  
- Select the best performing model  
- Predict churn for new customers  

---

## 🧠 Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature encoding and scaling  
- Handling imbalanced dataset using **SMOTE**  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Final prediction on new customer data  

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

> Random Forest achieved the best overall performance.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix   

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)  

---
## 📌 Key Insights
- The dataset is highly imbalanced  
- SMOTE improves model learning significantly  
- Customer tenure, contract type, and monthly charges strongly affect churn  
- Random Forest provides stable and accurate predictions
